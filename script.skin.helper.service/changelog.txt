								RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setkodisetting,setting=[NAME OF THE SETTING IN GUISETTINGS],value=[VALUE FOR THE SETTING])

								For example, this works:
								<onload>RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setkodisetting,setting=myvideos.extractchapterthumbs,value=false)</onload>

								This does not:
								<onload>RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setkodisetting,setting=myvideos.selectaction,value=3)</onload>

								Cannot set ints or strings. Tested on Krypton and Leia.

1.1.25
*cartman.dos
- fixed playtrailer method (and also ignoring dirs on youtube) 
- added new method: playtraileryoutube
- added new listitem property - CastListing
*marduk
- replaced remaining IsEmpty with String.IsEmpty

API:
CastListing -
Window(Home).Property(SkinHelper.ListItem.CastListing)
returns the cast list of a media formatted as ''actor1, actor2, actor3, ..." instead of kodi's native "actor1[cr]actor2[cr]actor3[cr]..."

playtraileryoutube - 
use by calling in skin:
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,ACTION=playtraileryoutube,mode=window/fullscreen,title=TITLE_NAME,local=BOOLEAN)

@param
mode - accepts either ''window'' or ''fullscreen' string. Note that playtrailer doesn't require this parameter and will play WINDOWED if omitted. 
title - string to look a trailer for in youtube (required param)
local - boolean that if true will look for a trailer in kodi's SYSTEM LANGUAGE, if omitted will be considered as false.

for example:
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,ACTION=playtraileryoutube,title=$INFO[ListItem.Title],local=$INFO[Skin.String(RegionalTrailers)])

Plays trailer auto (no dialog) for the title requested, windowed or fullscreen with regional language capability.
This method runs faster than playtrailer due to removed double-check that current focused media is the media 
that executed the script (a pro and a con in itself). Also this method does automatically search youtube and doesn't look for local/nfo listed trailer(!) AND allows to search for a regional trailer.
