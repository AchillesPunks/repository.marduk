TO DO LIST : 
	
	- toggle button can have altlabel, so var in dialog info isnt needed (trailer fs toggle)


	- if someone want use details widget in netflix home screens, than i need a var, for details panel bg (home 
		netflix), but using deatils in netflix could be obsolte since info is in spotlight

	- investigate -> bg / overlay behaviour, maybe also re switch to view(50) list behaviuor
	
	- widget details (landsc.d, posterd) - default use list item frames color instead widget frames, looks not bad but irritating
	- adjust global search script and textures
	- investigate spotlight refresh (1508, bingie)
	- need check -> 
	- add audio flags for music
	- no true fallback image for musicvideo in spotlight, - netflix views, (var=netflixhumb)spotlight image ,if 
		empty its fallback, change to a fixed image if empty( instead of last focus or whatever)	
	- music info : full witdh dialog, album thumbs dicography and some other layout improvements
	- finish header var for secondary header color
	- finish 3d view option and layout (https://streamable.com/4kn7g , ), later focus a viewtype for 
	albums/artists ()
	
	
	
	NEED CHECK
	- cutom color needs revisit 31829, 81813 - diifuse lyrics, missing in krypton, could be fix BG bug ??
	- slide menu needs custom focuspanle/focus text color ?, depending to skinbutton, + extra slide menu color 
	causing issues	IF: SideBladePanelColor(31601) near same as ButtonFocusColor(31233)	??
	- Director missing in dialogvideoinfo tv shows? 
	- need of 41633, should 41633 always set ?, check 31710 sh, 31796 yt lookup
	- PVR STUFF -

    - BUGS OPEN :	
        - MISC : 
		
		- <variable name="AudioChannelsVar"> - causing unwanted result in <!-- audo codec group --> 
			of netflix views(Bingie Home when using 
				Skin.String(mediaflagsstyle,classic) ;  Skin.String(mediaflagsstyle,classic) ;  
				Skin.String(osdmediaflagsstyle,classic); Skin.String(osdmediaflagsstyle,classic) 
		- krypton : TV Shows have an duration -> check the var
		
		- Media Flag layouts netflix  - since a/v is on top detail row in netflix view 
			a) MOVIES / EPISODES :
				- 523/525 - classic, all info on top (except video codec,aspect), 
				(- idea, marcel did great boxed info in classic (a/v with image), give optin skinsetting option, to use it as replacement for the simple details a/v flags)				
				- 523/525 - boxed : all info on top (except video codec,aspect)
				- 523/525 - textbased :  all info on top (except video codec,aspect), just need audio/subtitle lang
				- 523/525 - large color/mono - kepp it as it is ?
			b) TV SHOWS :
				- just need the status (ended ,continued...), maybe add an include to the "latrating" with visibl conds
				- 
			c) Seasons : 
				- 523	- boxed info ,didnt fit, size 'n' aesthetics
						- classic, fit if removed  mpaa, and frame status
						- textbased,large,colored fit if removed  mpaa
				- 525	- fixed layout can use the custom include for status/lastepisode
		- 
		a) a) MOVIES / EPISODES :
		PVR Stuff L E I A     O N L Y  :					
			a) home menu (dialogcontextmenu.xml -> has to high <height> , ) https://imgur.com/a/L8FPSd6 - use smallContextMenu instead till fix
			
			b) PVR/Live TV OSD -> switch channel (up/Down) custom id"206"/"201", working on android , not on (my)windows7, further test (leia)
			
		
			
		Playlist BUG 
			a) Shortcuts, not working add funcition, switch somewhat
		
		OSD :
			a) music/PVR, long named title(s) -> width to high cause overlay, [maybe set to autoscroll>true< ?,] rare issue 
			
		- general titan bugs:
			a)  seekslider not working in music
			b)	seekslider visible condtitions
			
		- LEIA ISSUES
			a) PVRListItemProperty Bug date [hhhh:mm]) ,LEIA BUG
								-> https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=330994&pid=2768212#pid2768212
			

		- strange footer behaviours:
			a) Studio Logos not visible for Movie-Sets in Netflix View, but in default Footer of other views everything is good 
			

		
	Clean Up :
		- check new includes if group tags really needed / doubled in the xml wich used the include
		- check the personal note markers and hope for remember why i add them <!-- check... --> lines 
		- delete classic theme ?
		- use plugin get cast fredsrepo (tested, not faster on win7,krypton)
			
	
	Low Prio:		
		- change dvd/bd ... cases overlays
		- var for tv show mpaa (text labels)
		- add info for sets ?
		- new widget type needs to be always fixed ? ( looks better)
		- 2nd busy setting (use just rotation animation (360) for custom single image ) ?
		- dialog keybord.xml , check change button layout
		- sometime check font.xml and dependencies
		- dont forget about - widget_layout_landscapedetails2
		- add MUSIC osd for netflix style ?? - actual its dependig to slim or default osd on MUSIC PLAYBACK
