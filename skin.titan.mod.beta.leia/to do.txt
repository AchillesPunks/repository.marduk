## BUGS open / to do

Header :
						- finish header var for secondary header color
						- https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=298565&pid=2553240#pid2553240 - for use in subheader, to have betteruse for secondary color ?

footer : 
						- add $INFO[ListItem.Top250] as first check for var
						- remove footer from panel wall view (520)/(519)
						- Studio Logos not visible for Movie-Sets in Netflix View, but in default Footer of other views everything is good 
						
dialog videoinfo : 
						- addon video source play/replay/resume issues ( need generell revisit )	https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=330749&pid=2787227#pid2787227
						- toggle button can have altlabel, so var in dialog info isnt needed (trailer fs toggle)
						- disabled - autoplay trailer in videoinfo screen (play in loop if not stop with x key, lost button focus in netflix layout)- temp disabled autoplay
						- Director missing in dialogvideoinfo tv shows? 
OSD :
						- no info + no poster avail = fanart position not at "bottom" -> recheck (default + slim)
						- pvr remaining time dont show correct ??? - couldnt reproduce
						- add "fake" toggle windowed button to osd

home :
						- bingie: 						- investigate spotlight refresh (1508, bingie)
						- horizontal layout :	-  nav issues in widgets
						- vertical layout : 	 	- option to disable slide and dont hide main
playlist 
						- bug / playlist creation bug - need investigative

views : 
						- with 1 row of items : add trailer navigation to force play on click
						- view 526 - make var as optional show unwatched items (season level) $season : episodes  (unwatched episodes)

Home / skinsettings :
						- monochrome ratings for bingie home, option , need recheck settings (divide for home and views?)
						
view (?) / include infoleft :
						- stretched fanart thumbs (e.g. twitch , yt)

myvideonav.xml : 
						- bg video (issue due to re positioning myvideonav.xml - need smarter solution

wide netflix (526):
						- check kodi wiki set context for content
										
touch support 	
						- more buttons to navigate touch support (e.g. sidepanel, trailer)
						- check where adjustents needed (e.g. OSD)
							
'fanart' 			  	- stretch (view info panel [ eg. stream thubs] ,  check fallback spotlight images var if empty , spotlight image (eg stream shows other thumb than focused, need test, but seems random)
						- just home ? addon video source fanart stuck on prev items sometimes (e.g. yt thumbs ) - seems random (seen it too on android, e.g. update fanart/library and browsing at same time)

widget layouts :
						- widget details (landsc.d, posterd) - default use list item frames color instead widget frames, looks not bad but irritating

script.globalsearch :
						- adjust global search script and textures

script.extendedinfo.dialogvideoinfo :
						- default kodi buttons id s not working as intended

misc :  
							- <variable name="AudioChannelsVar"> - causing unwanted result in <!-- audo codec group --> 
								of netflix views(Bingie Home when using 
								Skin.String(mediaflagsstyle,classic) ;  Skin.String(mediaflagsstyle,classic) ;  
								Skin.String(osdmediaflagsstyle,classic); Skin.String(osdmediaflagsstyle,classic) 
				
							
							- pvr  - previewwindow overlay (left / right info panel ) in view (?) - check, 1.9. should've solved it
							
							- lookup <!-- check, search for Property(TrailerPlaying)), need to set for autoplay --> , 
							
							- need check : update of script.nextup.notification (skin folder and relevance)
							
							# krypton only #  music OSD : dark overlay texture
					 			 				 music OSD : overlay of multiple lines of artist info 
								  				 autoplay trailer for widget (non spotlight)
								
							- autoplay trailer issues : just respect one variable for consistence , more broke it
							
							- need verifixarion, reported in Forum: I use the setting titan tiles (1 row small tiles).
								On Movies tiles in options , view options I try to change View list to Netflix
								But it each time I try this it crash kodi.
								
							- check overlay (currently over view(50) in views if "Player.hasvideo" seen on krypton android
								( panel detail view, overlay with an list view, unsure wich appears, also slide panel options of thst view occur)
								
							- investigate mysterious crashing leia ( fixed trough settings.xml ?  ) e.g. switch estuary before update,  home switch if sublevels, choose resource addons, switch colorthemes ) all lead to that same reason
								 the workaraound was working on android... but the reason is still unknown to me
								
							- gameosd.xml , need add and adjustments
			
							- open shutdown menu via "onback"  do autoclose choosen setting after open it - kodi "issue"


## suggestions / wishes to change ##

			Media Flag layouts netflix  - since a/v is on top detail row in netflix view :
				a) MOVIES / EPISODES :
					- 523/525 - classic, all info on top (except video codec,aspect), 
					(- idea, marcel did great boxed info in classic (a/v with image), give optin skinsetting option, to use it as replacement for the simple details a/v flags)				
					- 523/525 - boxed : all info on top (except video codec,aspect)
					- 523/525 - textbased :  all info on top (except video codec,aspect), just need audio/subtitle lang
					- 523/525 - large color/mono - kepp it as it is ?
				b) TV SHOWS :
					- just need the status (ended ,continued...), maybe add an include to the "latrating" with visibl conds
					- 
				c) Seasons : 
					- 523	- boxed info ,didnt fit, size 'n' aesthetics
							- classic, fit if removed  mpaa, and frame status
							- textbased,large,colored fit if removed  mpaa
					- 525	- fixed layout can use the custom include for status/lastepisode

			music info dialog :
				-  full witdh dialog, album thumbs dicography and some other layout improvements

				a) home menu (dialogcontextmenu.xml -> has to high <height> , ) https://imgur.com/a/L8FPSd6 - use smallContextMenu instead till fix
				
				b) PVR/Live TV OSD -> switch channel (up/Down) custom id"206"/"201", working on android , not on (my)windows7, further test (leia)
				
				c) labels, 
				
						ListItem.EpgEventIcon 	= show the current program image instead of the channel icon, if exists
						
						PVR.EpgEventIcon 		= Returns the icon of the currently playing EPG programme (if available)
						
						ListItem.Player.Icon	= Returns the thumbnail of the currently playing item. If no thumbnail image exists, the icon will be returned, if available.
						
				d) You can now add a list control with id="11" to MyPVRGuide.xml This container will allow the user to select the channel group from a list.
