		Notes/issues:
			
			- autoplay trailer in videoinfo screen (play in loop if not stop with x key, lost button focus in netflix layout)- temp disabled autoplay
			
			- https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=330749&pid=2787227#pid2787227
			
			- widget refreshing on playback, generell refresh on video/trailer playback, instead of just needed (movie,episode,....) https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=330749&pid=2787978#pid2787978
						(it's fine, only issue i can think off that widgets tries to change based on trailer streams (yt) -> shw)
			- krypton (dark overlay) music OSD
			- krypton only? - reported overlay of multiple lines of artist info 
			
			- behaviour of play / resume in netflix info dialog
			
			- behaviour resume in extended info dialog -> seems related to extended info, failded to load /set focus on media (just uses close function)
			
			- uppercase issue in title label (eg weather)
			- pvr  - previewwindow overlay (left / right info panel ) in view (?)
			- more buttons to navigate touch support (e.g. sidepanel, trailer) / fix overlay trough mod (e.g. osd)
			- view 526 - make var as optional show unwatched items (season level) $season : episodes 
			(unwatched episodes)
			- trailers should always use system lang instead be optional
			- osd disable info if settings dialog is visible (krypton) , leia need add osdsubtitledialog 
			as condition
			- fanart :  stretch (view info panel [ eg. stream thubs] ,  check fallback spotlight images var
			if empty , spotlight image (eg stream shows other thumb than focused, need test)
			- bingie home - rating position if not 1st row/ (widget header count into widget height)
							
			- sometimes still stuck in spotlight? - no way to mav out (happend on krypton android)
				
			- krypton : autoplay trailer issues (non spotlight)
								
			- ost themes manfeed or addon based ?
			- monochrome ratings for bingie home, option , need look at
			

			https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=298565&pid=2553240#pid2553240 - for use in subheader, to have betteruse for secondary color ?
			
			- remove footer from panel wall view (520)/(519)
			- lookup <!-- check, search for Property(TrailerPlaying)), need to set for autoplay --> , 
			- gameosd.xml , need add and adjustments
			
			- Krypton : investigate and fix autoplay trailer behaviours (non netflixhome/netfixhome)
			
			- adjust some layouts for touch mode (e.g OSD overlays)
			
			- add "fake" toggle windowed button to osd
			
			- toggle button can have altlabel, so var in dialog info isnt needed (trailer fs toggle)
			
			- if someone want use details widget in netflix home screens, than i need a var, for details panel bg (home 
				netflix), but using deatils in netflix could be obsolte since info is in spotlight
			
			- investigate -> bg / overlay behaviour, maybe also re switch to view(50) list behaviuor
			
			- widget details (landsc.d, posterd) - default use list item frames color instead widget frames, looks not bad but irritating
			
			- adjust global search script and textures
			
			- investigate spotlight refresh (1508, bingie)
			
			- Media Flag layouts netflix  - since a/v is on top detail row in netflix view 
				a) MOVIES / EPISODES :
					- 523/525 - classic, all info on top (except video codec,aspect), 
					(- idea, marcel did great boxed info in classic (a/v with image), give optin skinsetting option, to use it as replacement for the simple details a/v flags)				
					- 523/525 - boxed : all info on top (except video codec,aspect)
					- 523/525 - textbased :  all info on top (except video codec,aspect), just need audio/subtitle lang
					- 523/525 - large color/mono - kepp it as it is ?
				b) TV SHOWS :
					- just need the status (ended ,continued...), maybe add an include to the "latrating" with visibl conds
					- 
				c) Seasons : 
					- 523	- boxed info ,didnt fit, size 'n' aesthetics
							- classic, fit if removed  mpaa, and frame status
							- textbased,large,colored fit if removed  mpaa
					- 525	- fixed layout can use the custom include for status/lastepisode
			
			
			- no true fallback image "spotlight" - netflix views, (var=netflixhumb)spotlight image ,if 
				empty its fallback, change to a fixed image if empty( instead of last focus or whatever)	
			
			- music info : full witdh dialog, album thumbs dicography and some other layout improvements
			
			- finish header var for secondary header color
			
			- finish 3d view option and layout (https://streamable.com/4kn7g , ), later focus a viewtype for  albums/artists ()
			
			- cutom color needs revisit 31829
			
			- slide menu needs custom focuspanle/focus text color ?, depending to skinbutton, + extra slide menu color 
				causing issues	IF: SideBladePanelColor(31601) near same as ButtonFocusColor(31233)	??
			
			- Director missing in dialogvideoinfo tv shows? 
			
			- need of 41633, should 41633 always set ?, check 31710 sh, 31796 yt lookup

				c) labels, 
				
						ListItem.EpgEventIcon 	= show the current program image instead of the channel icon, if exists
						
						PVR.EpgEventIcon 		= Returns the icon of the currently playing EPG programme (if available)
						
						ListItem.Player.Icon	= Returns the thumbnail of the currently playing item. If no thumbnail image exists, the icon will be returned, if available.
						
				d) You can now add a list control with id="11" to MyPVRGuide.xml This container will allow the user to select the channel group from a list.
